# Decision Frameworks Reference

Frameworks tailored to each decision type. Councils should apply the relevant framework when analyzing a decision.

## Strategic Decisions

**Examples:** Market entry, product pivots, positioning changes, partnership decisions, long-term direction.

### Framework: Strategic Assessment Matrix

1. **Current State** - Where are you now? (honest assessment)
2. **Desired State** - Where do you want to be? (specific, measurable)
3. **Gap Analysis** - What's between here and there?
4. **Strategic Options** - What are the 2-3 realistic paths?
5. **Competitive Landscape** - Who else is doing this? What's different?
6. **Timing** - Is now the right time? Why now vs later?
7. **Resource Requirements** - What does each option cost in time, money, people?
8. **Irreversibility** - Which options are one-way doors vs two-way doors?

### Key Questions
- Does this create or erode competitive advantage?
- Does this align with long-term vision or is it a distraction?
- What are the second-order effects on existing commitments?
- If a competitor made this move, would you worry?

### Evaluation Criteria
- Strategic alignment (does this advance the core mission?)
- Competitive differentiation (does this create distance from alternatives?)
- Timing advantage (is there a window of opportunity?)
- Resource efficiency (does the investment match the potential return?)

## Financial Decisions

**Examples:** Investment decisions, pricing changes, hiring, equipment purchases, revenue model changes.

### Framework: Financial Impact Analysis

1. **Direct Costs** - What's the immediate financial outlay?
2. **Opportunity Cost** - What else could this money/time do?
3. **Revenue Impact** - How does this affect income (short and long-term)?
4. **Break-Even Analysis** - When does this pay for itself?
5. **Downside Scenario** - What if it fails? What do you lose?
6. **Upside Scenario** - What if it succeeds beyond expectations?
7. **Cash Flow Timing** - When do costs hit vs when do returns come?
8. **Tax & Legal Implications** - Any financial structure considerations?

### Key Questions
- What's the ROI timeline?
- Is this a fixed cost or a variable cost?
- Does this create recurring revenue or one-time income?
- What's the minimum viable investment to test this?

### Evaluation Criteria
- ROI potential (expected return relative to investment)
- Cash flow impact (timing of costs vs returns)
- Risk-adjusted return (upside weighted against downside)
- Financial sustainability (can you absorb the worst case?)

## Career Decisions

**Examples:** Job changes, skill investment, role transitions, education, freelance vs employment.

### Framework: Career Trajectory Analysis

1. **Skill Compounding** - Does this build on existing skills or start fresh?
2. **Network Effect** - Does this expand your professional network meaningfully?
3. **Optionality** - Does this open future doors or narrow them?
4. **Market Value** - Does this increase or decrease your market value?
5. **Learning Curve** - What's the investment to become effective?
6. **Identity Alignment** - Does this align with who you want to be?
7. **Regret Minimization** - In 10 years, which choice will you regret less?
8. **Practical Constraints** - Financial obligations, family needs, geography

### Key Questions
- What skills will you have in 3 years that you don't have now?
- If this job/path disappeared tomorrow, what would you do?
- Are you running toward something or away from something?
- What does your ideal workday look like?

### Evaluation Criteria
- Growth potential (skill and career trajectory)
- Financial trajectory (earning potential over 5 years)
- Life integration (compatibility with personal life goals)
- Reversibility (can you go back if it doesn't work?)

## Technical Decisions

**Examples:** Architecture choices, tool selection, build vs buy, migration, tech stack changes.

### Framework: Technical Decision Record

1. **Problem Statement** - What specific problem does this solve?
2. **Constraints** - What are the non-negotiables (performance, cost, team skill)?
3. **Options Considered** - At least 3 options including "do nothing"
4. **Evaluation Criteria** - Weighted criteria for comparison
5. **Proof of Concept** - Can you prototype the top 2 options?
6. **Migration Path** - How do you get from current state to desired state?
7. **Operational Impact** - How does this affect day-to-day operations?
8. **Reversibility** - How hard is it to undo this choice?

### Key Questions
- What does the ecosystem look like in 3-5 years?
- Who else uses this at scale? What are their experiences?
- What's the team's learning curve?
- What are the hidden operational costs?

### Evaluation Criteria
- Fitness for purpose (does it solve the actual problem?)
- Ecosystem health (community, maintenance, longevity)
- Team capability (can the current team execute this?)
- Operational cost (total cost of ownership over 3 years)

## Personal Decisions

**Examples:** Life changes, relationship decisions, relocation, health choices, lifestyle changes.

### Framework: Life Integration Assessment

1. **Values Alignment** - Does this align with your core values?
2. **Relationship Impact** - How does this affect key relationships?
3. **Health Impact** - Physical, mental, and emotional effects?
4. **Identity** - Is this who you want to be?
5. **Sustainability** - Can you maintain this long-term?
6. **Regret Analysis** - Which choice minimizes long-term regret?
7. **Energy Audit** - Does this energize you or drain you?
8. **Support System** - Do the people around you support this?

### Key Questions
- If money weren't a factor, would you still make this choice?
- Are you making this decision from a place of strength or fear?
- How does this affect the people who depend on you?
- What would your best self choose?

### Evaluation Criteria
- Happiness potential (genuine fulfillment, not just pleasure)
- Relationship health (strengthens or strains key relationships)
- Personal growth (challenges you to grow)
- Sustainability (maintainable without chronic stress)

## Risk Decisions

**Examples:** Insurance, safety measures, contingency planning, security investments, legal protections.

### Framework: Risk Management Matrix

1. **Threat Identification** - What are all the things that could go wrong?
2. **Probability Assessment** - How likely is each threat? (1-5 scale)
3. **Impact Assessment** - How bad is each threat if it happens? (1-5 scale)
4. **Risk Score** - Probability x Impact for each threat
5. **Mitigation Options** - What can reduce probability or impact?
6. **Cost of Mitigation** - What does each mitigation cost?
7. **Residual Risk** - What risk remains after mitigation?
8. **Acceptance Threshold** - What level of risk is acceptable?

### Risk Classification

| Probability \ Impact | Low (1-2) | Medium (3) | High (4-5) |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **High (4-5)** | Monitor | Mitigate | Eliminate |
| **Medium (3)** | Accept | Mitigate | Mitigate |
| **Low (1-2)** | Accept | Accept | Monitor |

### Key Questions
- What's the worst case and can you survive it?
- Is the cost of mitigation proportional to the risk?
- Are you insuring against a real threat or an imagined one?
- What's the cost of NOT mitigating this risk?

### Evaluation Criteria
- Expected loss (probability x impact in concrete terms)
- Mitigation cost-effectiveness (cost to mitigate vs expected loss)
- Cascading risk (does this failure trigger other failures?)
- Recovery time (how long to return to normal?)

## Cross-Cutting Principles

These principles apply regardless of decision type:

### The Two-Way Door Test (Jeff Bezos)
- **One-way doors:** Irreversible decisions. Deliberate carefully.
- **Two-way doors:** Reversible decisions. Decide quickly, adjust later.
- Most decisions are two-way doors treated as one-way doors.

### The Regret Minimization Framework
- Project yourself to age 80
- Look back on this decision
- Which choice minimizes regret?
- Bias toward action for things you'll regret NOT doing

### The 10/10/10 Rule
- How will you feel about this decision in 10 minutes?
- In 10 months?
- In 10 years?

### The Reversibility Spectrum
- **Fully reversible:** Just do it. Optimize for speed.
- **Partially reversible:** Test small, then commit.
- **Irreversible:** Full deliberation. Use ultra mode.

### Confidence Calibration
- **HIGH confidence:** Strong evidence, clear consensus, precedent exists
- **MEDIUM confidence:** Some evidence, reasonable arguments on both sides
- **LOW confidence:** Limited data, novel situation, conflicting signals
- **Very honest note:** If you're unsure, say so. False confidence is worse than acknowledged uncertainty.
